    <string name="plectrum_lesson"><b>Lesson 4 - </b>A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a guitar. A pick (aka plectrum) is used to get the brightest and best sound from a guitar, especially in Pop and Rock music. \n\n
        Some beginners are very reluctant to use a pick. However, ESPECIALLY in the early days, I really recommend persisting no matter how many times it
        spins around in your hand or how often you drop it. It is simply the easiest way to get the best sound from your guitar for most pop and rock styles.
        Once you have a solid foundation of chords and rhythm, you can always learn folk ‘finger style’ playing at a later date.</string>
    <string name="chord_lesson"><b>Lesson 5 - </b>Chord boxes show us where to put our fingers for each chord. Here is the chord box for the E Chord (E major). The black dots show where to place your fingers. And the numbers show which finger you should use (1 is index finger, 2 is middle finger etc). In this chord above, we strum all 6 strings on the guitar.</string>

    <string name="level1_lesson1_title">Lesson 1: Parts of an Acoustic Guitar</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson1_tv1">Welcome to Lesson 1 of GuitarPal! Once you\'ve purchased your guitar, it\'s time to learn all the parts that comprise the acoustic guitar. This information will come in handy when it comes time for repairs or general maintenance, which are always essential to being a guitar player.</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson1_tv2"><b>Body:</b> The body of the acoustic guitar is what gives the instrument its sound and beauty. Its the big hollow shape, or sound box, that resonates when you play the strings. Its what makes the guitar sound like a guitar.
                                        \n\n<b>Neck:</b> The guitar neck is the long wooden shaft that tapers down to the headstock. Each string runs along this extension, and depending on where your fingers are placed on each string up and down the neck, you make different tones that resonate throughout the guitar. The face of the neck is called the fretboard because that is where the guitar frets are located.
                                        \n\n<b>Head (Headstock):</b> At the end of the guitar neck, there is the headstock. It is fitted with tuners or machine heads that adjust the tension of the strings, therefore changing the pitch of the guitar.
                                        \n\n<b>Tuners (Machine Heads):</b> These metal pegs adjust the tension of the guitar strings to raise or lower their pitches depending on whether or not you turn them clockwise or counterclockwise.
                                        \n\n<b>Nut: </b>The nut is the thin white piece that separates the neck from the headstock. It separates each guitar string going down the neck so that they are evenly spaced out in order to be played.
                                        \n\n<b>Frets:</b> Frets are the thin metal pieces on the fretboard that run perpendicular to the guitar neck, and act as tone separators for the guitar. They separate the guitar neck into semitones or half steps making the guitar neck act as a grid from which you play musical tones.
                                        \n\n<b>Sound Hole: </b>The sound hole is the reason that sound escapes the body of the guitar. When a string is plucked, this sound bounces around the inside of the guitar, eventually escaping through the sound hole and into our ears.
                                        \n\n<b>Bridge:</b> The bridge of the guitar holds the guitar strings firmly on the body so that they do not loose tension and therefore change pitch. When a string is plucked, vibrations run from the bridge all the way down the neck to the nut.
                                        \n\n<b>Bridge Pegs:</b> These are used on acoustic guitars to fasten the ends of the strings to the bridge. They are the nails that keep each string secured to the wooden bridge.
                                        \n\n<b>Pickguard: </b>Over time, strumming with a pick can do some wear and tear. Thats why the pickguard is there to protect the guitars body from dings and scratches.</string>

    <string name="level1_lesson2_title">Lesson 2: Parts of an Electric Guitar</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson2_tv1">There is no real difference between the electric guitar and the acoustic guitar when it comes to playing, if you can play one, you can play the other! You can see below that the electric also has a body, a neck, a freboard and headstock.</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson2_tv2"><b>Pickguard:</b> Over time, strumming with a pick can do some wear and tear. That\'s why the pickguard is there to protect the guitars body from dings and scratches.
                                        \n\n<b>Strap Button: </b>There are two strap buttons on an electric guitar: one at the top of the body and one at the base. These are there to hold your guitar strap in place when you\’re using one to stand and play guitar at the same time.</string>
     <string name="level1_lesson2_tv3"><b>Bridge:</b> The bridge of the guitar holds the guitar strings firmly on the body so that they do not loose tension and therefore change pitch. When a string is plucked, vibrations run from the bridge all the way down the neck to the nut. Each string on the electric guitar is assigned to its own metal spring piece on the bridge called a saddle. These saddles can be adjusted to slightly alter the tension of each string therefore changing the string\'s intonation.
                                        \n\n<b>Pickups:</b> While acoustics use sound holes to release sound, electrics use pickups. Pickups are small microphones, or transducers that pick up the vibrations from each string and convert them into electrical signals.
                                        \n\n<b>Pickup Selector (Toggle Switch):</b> This switch triggers which pickups are going to be used to make the sound of the strings. The number of pickups can vary depending on which guitar you have, so you may have anywhere from a 5 setting toggle switch or no switch at all.
                                        \n\n<b>Volume Knob:</b> This knob adjusts the amount of power you are giving the pickups, ultimately adjusting how loud or quite your guitar is.
                                        \n\n<b>Tone Knobs: </b>These knobs adjust precisely how the pickups sound (treble and bass). Depending on which way you turn them, your guitar may sound bright and tinny, or dark and muffled.
                                        \n\n<b>Output Jack:</b> The output jack is where you insert the power cable that connects to your amplifier. This jack is how the electronic signals from the pickups travel out of the guitar, through an amplifier and into our ears.</string>

    <string name="level1_lesson3_title">Lesson 3: How to Hold the Guitar</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson3_tv1">Learning the correct way to hold your guitar can mean the difference between making something easier to play and making something harder to play on guitar. Once you learn how to properly position your guitar, learning to play will feel intuitive and natural.</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson3_tv2"><b>Step 1: </b>Find a comfortable chair without arms. This will give you more freedom to move around while you\'re playing the guitar.
                                    \n\n<b>Step 2: </b>Place the guitar on the top of your right knee. If you were left handed, you would place the guitar on the top of your left knee.
                                    \n\n<b>Step 3: </b>Tilt the guitar back towards you slightly. This limits the amount of stretching your left hand has to do while playing and therefore making the instrument easier to play than if it were tilted away from you.
                                    \n\n<b>Step 4: </b>Your strumming hand should rest comfortably on the guitar in such a way that your wrist is poised right above the pickups (or sound hole on acoustics).
                                    \n\n<b>Step 5: </b>The neck should be parallel to the floor. You will get the most comfort and playing versatility out of holding the guitar this way.
                                    \n\n<b>Step 6: </b>Make sure that the thickest string is the string that\'s closest to you. This holds true for both right and left handed guitars.
                                    \n\n<b>Step 7: </b>With your left hand (or right hand if you\'re left handed), place your thumb on the back of the guitar neck, right in the middle. This way, your fingers will curl around the neck easily and comfortably to put you in the correct playing position.</string>

    <string name="level1_lesson4_title">Lesson 4: How to Hold a Guitar Pick</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson4_tv1"><b>1.</b>	Hold your picking hand (the one that holds the pick) so that the back of the thumb is facing upwards.
                                        \n\n<b>2.</b> Relax the hand completely, this should allow the fingers to curl up.
                                        \n\n<b>3.</b> Place the pick on to the side of your index finger. The pointed end of the pick should face toward the nail of your index finger.
                                        \n\n<b>4.</b> Place your thumb onto the pick to keep it clamped between your thumb and finger.</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson4_tv2">Make sure your grip on the pick is relaxed. Do not squeeze the pick. Have the pick positioned at a 10% angle to the string, not completely parallel. How you hold the pick is a matter of personal taste, however, there are guidelines on how to hold a pick. Fast lead playing requires small, consistent motions so only 2mm of the tip of the pick should be used (as a rough guideline), whereas strumming requires a more open grip on the pick.
                                        \n\nShould I Use a Pick?
                                        \n\nNot every one will chose to use a pick, especially folk guitarists and similar style players. Non pick users will use either finger picking or hybrid picking (both pick and fingers). Using fingerpicks and thumbpicks should be referred to as finger picking because using them employs the same movements and style.
                                        \n\nPicks come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from 0.36mm to 3mm in thickness and from the size of a thumbnail to a 50p piece. Strumming chords favours a thin pick but thickness is a clear advantage for single-note pieces. Beginners tend to favour thinner picks but usually use thicker picks as they get used to the feel of them. A 0.9mm pick is a good all-rounder.</string>

    <string name="level1_lesson5_title">Lesson 5: Names of the Guitar Strings</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson5_tv1">In order to be a guitarist, it\'s absolutely crucial that you memorize the 6 strings on a guitar. Well then, what are they?</string>
    <string name="level1_lesson5_tv2">The thickest string is called the 6th string. In standard guitar tuning, this is tuned to E. We often refer to this as the \‘low E string\‘. This is the deepest/lowest guitar note you can play.
                                        \n\nThe 5th string is tuned to A, so it\’s usually referred to as the A string.
                                        \n\nThe 4th string is tuned to D, so it\’s usually referred to as the D string.
                                        \n\nThe 3rd string is tuned to G, so it\’s usually referred to as the G string.
                                        \n\nThe 2nd string is tuned to B, so it\’s usually referred to as the B string.
                                        \n\nThe 1st string is tuned to E. This is the thinnest of all the strings. We often refer to this as the \‘high E string\’.</string>
     <string name="level1_lesson5_tv3">\n\nHow to remember the guitar string names? The easiest way to remember the guitar string names is to use a mnemonic. The sillier the better! Here\’s a couple of fun ways to remember this:

    <string name="level2_intro_title">Level 2: Introduction</string>
    <string name="level2_intro_tv1">Welcome to the second level of GuitarPal!</string>
    <string name="level2_intro_tv2">\nIn this level, you will be introduced to various extremely important aspects of playing guitar such as how to tune a guitar, getting to know the fretboard and how to read chord charts and guitar tabs. So swipe the screen to the left and lets begin!</string>

    <string name="level2_lesson1_title">Lesson 1: How to Tune a Guitar</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson1_tv1">It is essential for any guitarist to keep their guitar in tune. This app has a tuner which can help you tune your guitar to standard EADGBe tuning. But you may be in situations where you need to tune the guitar manually without a tuner. As a beginner you may find that manual tuning is very difficult and very frustrating.</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson1_tv2"><b>Fifth fret trick</b>
                                    \n\nThe fifth fret trick is the most common method of relative tuning and is outlined below:
                                    \n\n1.	Estimate the pitch of the 6th string (the thickest string). There are lots of ways you can do this, the easiest way being just use you ear alone and guess. Alternatively, your ear can be guided by a pitch pipe, tuning fork, audio tuning guide, or the E on another instrument, such as a keyboard.
                                    \n\n2.	Place and hold a finger on the 5th fret of the 6th string then pluck the 6th string followed by the 5th string. These two notes should be the same (A). Once you\'ve tuned the open A (5th string) you can continue with the rest of the strings.
                                    \n\n3.	Play the 5th fret of the 5th string (the note should be D) and tune the 4th string to the same pitch.
                                    \n\n4.	Play the 5th fret of the 4th string (G) and tune the 3rd string accordingly.
                                    \n\n5.	Play the 4th fret of the 3rd string (B) and tune the 2nd string accordingly.
                                    \n\n6.	Play the 5th of the 2nd string (E) and tune the 1st string accordingly.
                                    \n\nTip - When using an amplifier you can make tuning easier by turning the volume up. Listen out for a wobbling sound; notice how this sound slows down as you get closer to the right tuning. This wobbling sound should stop when you are in tune and is easier to hear on the higher sounding strings.
                                    </string>

    <string name="level2_lesson2_title">Lesson 2: How to Restring a Guitar</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson2_tv1">You may need to restring your guitar from time to time. This may because a string may break or maybe the strings just need changing if they get dull and dirty. Here we look at how to change strings for both an electric and an acoustic guitar.</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson2_tv2">\n<b>Standard electric guitars</b>
                                \n\n1.	Unwind all of the machineheads and remove the old strings. This can be made easier with string winders and string cutters.
                                \n\n2.	Place the new string through the hole in the bridge. This is usually accessed on the reverse side of the body.
                                \n\n3.	Thread the string through the string-post then cut the string, leaving 5cm (approx.) of length spare.
                                \n\n4.	Wrap the string around the tuning peg then tighten the machinehead, leaving some slack on the string. Tighten until the string supports itself.
                                \n\n5.	Repeat steps 2-4 for all of the strings.
                                \n\n6.	Tune each string to the correct pitch.
                                \n\n7.	Stretch each string by pulling it away from the fretboard.
                                \n\n8.	Tune each string to the correct pitch again. If you find that the strings are slipping out of tune repeat steps 7 and 8. This should stabilise the tuning.
                                \n\n<b>Acoustic/classical guitars</b>
                                \n\n1.	Unwind one of the machineheads and remove the old string. This can be made easier with string winders and string cutters.
                                \n\n2.	Tie the new string to the bridge, making sure you mimic the method used to tie the old strings (this is why you should change just one string to start with).
                                \n\n3.	Thread the new string through the string-post then cut the string, leaving 5cm (approx.) of length spare.
                                \n\n4.	Wrap the string around the tuning peg then tighten the machinehead, leaving some slack on the string. Tighten until the string supports itself.
                                \n\n5.	Repeat steps 1-4 for all of the strings.
                                \n\n6.	Tune each string to the correct pitch.
                                \n\n7.	Stretch each string.
                                \n\n8.	To ensure stable tuning repeat steps 6 and 7.</string>

    <string name="level2_lesson3_title">Lesson 3: Getting to know the Fretboard</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson3_tv1">Frets are the silver strips of metal that run up and down the entire length of (most) guitar fretboards, or the front face of the guitar neck. If you hold down a string between different frets while plucking that same string throughout, you\'ll notice the pitch of your notes change each time you go over a new fret wire. This is because the main job of frets is to control the intonation of each string, helping guitarists select which notes and chords they play.</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson3_tv2">The inlaid dots on the fretboard are fret markers that indicate specific fret numbers. The double dot indicates that it is one octave above the open string, therefore restarting the notes in the series. Typically, these dots follow this pattern:
                                    \n\n1st single dot = 3rd fret
                                    \n2nd single dot = 5th fret
                                    \n3rd single dot = 7th fret
                                    \n4th single dot = 9th fret
                                    \nDouble dot = 12th fret
                                    \n5th single dot = 15th fret
                                    \n6th single dot = 17th fret
                                    \n7th single dot = 19th fret
                                    \n8th single dot = 21st fret
                                    </string>

    <string name="level2_lesson4_title">Lesson 4: How to Read Guitar Chord Charts</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson4_tv1">A trick to learning chord charts is to stand your guitar so that the headstock is pointing directly up. Then look at 4 frets. That\'s your basic chord chart. The 6 vertical lines represent 6 strings, although, the names of the strings rarely ever appear on the actual chord chart itself. The 5 horizontal lines represent the metal frets, but again, these numbers usually don\'t appear on the chord chart. The black dots represent where you put your fingers. In the example, left, you would put a finger on the 3rd fret of the 5th string and on the 2nd fret of the 3rd string.</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson4_tv2">If you see an "0" above one of the vertical lines, it means that the open string is played. No finger should be placed on that string. If you see an "X" above one of the vertical lines, it means that particular string shouldn\'t be played at all. If you see a number next to the top horizontal line, it means that you should start forming the chord based on that numbered fret. In the example, left, you would start on the 7th fret (imagine the 7th fret as the nut of the guitar), putting a finger on the 8th fret of the 4th string and another finger on the 10th fret of the 3rd string.</string>

    <string name="level2_lesson5_title">Lesson 5: How to Read Guitar Tabs</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson5_tv1">Reading tablature (guitar tab) is quite simple, and the main advantage of learning to read tabs is that you can find tabs of almost any song or guitar solo online for free.</string>
    <string name="level2_lesson5_tv2">The way tabs are displayed is the same as if you rotated your guitar neck so that it\'s facing you. The letters all the way to the left are the names of the six strings from highest to lowest, and the dashes running horizontally are there to represent the strings themselves. The numbers represent which fret to play, the 0\'s represent that you play an open string, and the x\'s represent a string that isn\'t played. It\'s a lot like reading chord charts in that way.

    <string name="level3_intro_tv1">Welcome to the third level of GuitarPal!</string>
    <string name="level3_intro_tv2">\nIn this level, you will be introduced to some basic chords. There are two main types of chords, Major and Minor. Major chords sound happy and Minor chords sound sad. Once you learn these chords, try and switch between these chords and play around with them. The chords shown in this level are in the same key of Gmajor so it will sound perfectly fine to jam around between these chords and you can even write 1000s of songs with these chords!
